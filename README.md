# Allnie Keychain


## Allnie Key chain is building an opensource wallet that enables aanyone to add their currency into the wallet. Our guiding principles are as follows: 

### Currency Customization over gatekeeping: 
To be able to add any cryptocurrency vs having a central party dictate what currency gets added. 


### Function over aesthetic:
The wallet should be functional and friendly for users. Aesthetics are designed by the open source community. 

So the journey begins! Will you be a part of it?
